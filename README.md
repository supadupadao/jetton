# TON Jetton contract on Tact

ℹ️ Jetton implementation for The Open Network written in Tact language. Metadata is fully decentralized, it means that full token metadata is stored on-chain.

⚠️ <b>Warning!</b> This contract is not 100% tested and I would not recommend using it in production yet.

❤️ I'll be very grateful for any kind of contribution: code, docs, issues, bug reports, github stars or whatever

# Development
